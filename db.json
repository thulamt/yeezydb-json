      "body": "The adidas Yeezy 350 Boost V2 takes the silhouette that Kanye West made famous for adidas Originals and gives it new life. The Yeezy Boost releases have been some of the most notable driving forces in the resurgence of adidas' popularity around the world. The low top Yeezy Boost 350 features a full length Boost cushioning system and a high end feel that has made it the go-to sneaker for everyone from celebrities like Kim Kardashian-West, Jay-Z, 2 Chainz and Future, as well as for athletes like Nick \"Swaggy P\" Young, Andrew Wiggins, Lewis Hamilton and anyone else who can get their feet in a pair. The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 adds a bold twist to Kanye's design with a bright orange (officially Solar Red) stripe across the Steel Grey/Beluga zebra-striped upper with the text YZY SPLY.\nThe Steeple Gray/Beluga/Solar Red adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 is the first of the 2nd version colorways that release in 2016.\n-StockX",

The Yeezy 700 Wave Runner features a grey mesh and leather upper with black suede overlays and teal mesh underlays. At the base, a thick Boost sole and contrasting hits of orange complete the design.\nThe adidas Yeezy Boost 700 Wave Runner originally released in November of 2017, and most recently re-released in March of 2022 for a retail price of $300.\n-StockX",
